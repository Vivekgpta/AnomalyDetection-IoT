# Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection for IoT Networks

This project uses deep learning to detect anomalies in IoT network traffic.

## Structure
- `src/` contains modular code for loading data, model training, and evaluation
- `notebooks/` contains the original exploratory notebook
- `outputs/` stores generated models and plots

## Usage
1. Place your dataset in the `data/` folder.
2. Run `run.py` to train and evaluate the model.

## Requirements
Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
